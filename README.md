# Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression using the scikit-learn library in Python & R. The goal is to predict the salary of employees based on their years of experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Salary_Data.csv`, which contains two columns:

- `YearsExperience`: The number of years of experience for an employee.
- `Salary`: The corresponding salary for the employee.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have the `Salary_Data.csv` file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script:

The script will perform the following steps:

1. Import the required libraries.
2. Load the dataset from `Salary_Data.csv`.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a Simple Linear Regression model on the training set.
5. Make predictions on the testing set.
6. Visualize the training set results by plotting a scatter plot and the regression line.
7. Visualize the testing set results by plotting a scatter plot and the regression line.

## Results

The script will display two plots:

1. **Salary vs. Experience (Training set)**: This plot shows the scatter plot of the training data points and the regression line fitted to the training data.

2. **Salary vs. Experience (Test set)**: This plot shows the scatter plot of the testing data points and the regression line fitted to the training data.
