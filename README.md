This project demonstrates the use of Simple Linear Regression to predict salaries based on years of experience.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Salary_Data.csv, which contains two columns:

YearsExperience: The number of years of experience of an employee.
Salary: The corresponding salary of the employee.
